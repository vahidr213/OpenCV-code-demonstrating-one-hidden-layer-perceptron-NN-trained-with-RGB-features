# OpenCV-code-demonstrating-one-hidden-layer-perceptron-NN-trained-with-RGB-features
OpenCV sample work that demonstrates why one hidden layer perceptron neural network trained with RGB intensity values as feature vector may fail in segmenting water pixels from non-water pixel in underwater images considering a range of under thousand neurons
